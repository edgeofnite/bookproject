You can now start writing chapter <%= @chapter.number %> of "<%= @chapter.book.title %>".

Please log into our site to start writing.  When you are done writing,
select the "Finished" button.  We will send the chapter to your editor
for review.

Use this link to edit your chapter:
<%= url_for :controller => "book", :action =>"editBook", :id => @chapter.book, :only_path => false  %>


Have a great time writing,
<%= @chapter.book.project.owner.username %> and The Book Project Team
