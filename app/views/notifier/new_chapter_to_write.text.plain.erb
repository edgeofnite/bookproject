Dear <%= @chapter.user.username %>
  You have been asked to write chapter <%= @chapter.number %> of "<%= @chapter.book.title %>".

<% if @chapter.number == 1 or @chapter.book.chapters[@chapter.number-2].state == "accepted" %>
Please log into our site to start writing.  When you are done writing,
select the "Finished" button.  We will sent the chapter to your editor
for review.

Use this link to edit your chapter:
<%= url_for :controller => "book", :action =>"editBook", :id => @chapter.book, :only_path => false  %>
<% else %>
The previous chapters are not yet complete.  You will receive a new email
message when the book is ready for you to write.
<% end %>
Have a great time writing,
<%= @chapter.book.project.owner.username %> and The Book Project Team
